                    <h4>Answer: Defragmentation Software</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The clicking noises and slow loading suggest the read/write head is moving frequently to access fragmented files.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Files have become scattered across the disk over time</li>
                        <li>Defragmentation reorganises files into contiguous blocks</li>
                        <li>This reduces head movement and speeds up file access</li>

                    <h4>Answer: Data Compression Software</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Compression software can reduce the total file size to fit within the email limit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ZIP compression can combine all 50 images into one archive</li>
                        <li>The compressed archive will be significantly smaller</li>
                        <li>May need to send in multiple compressed batches if still over 25MB</li>

                    <h4>Answer: Data Compression Software</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Compressing infrequently accessed files saves storage space.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Old files can be compressed into ZIP archives</li>

                    <h4>Answer: NO - Do NOT defragment an SSD</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Defragmentation is unnecessary and harmful for SSDs.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SSDs have no moving parts - they access any location equally fast</li>
                        <li>Defragmentation causes many unnecessary write operations</li>
                        <li>SSDs have limited write cycles - unnecessary writes reduce lifespan</li>
                        <li>Modern operating systems disable defrag for SSDs automatically</li>
                        <li>SSDs use TRIM instead to manage deleted data efficiently</li>

                    <h4>Answer: Encryption</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Encryption protects data during transmission over networks.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTPS uses encryption to secure the connection</li>
                        <li>Data is encrypted before being sent across the internet</li>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Over 3 years, files have become fragmented, causing slow write operations.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Files and deletions over time create gaps in storage</li>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Lossy compression dramatically reduces audio file sizes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removes audio frequencies humans can't easily hear</li>

                <p>A web developer has uploaded high-quality photographs to a website, but pages are loading slowly. They need to reduce image file sizes to improve loading speed while keeping images looking good.</p>

                    <h4>Answer: Lossy Compression (JPEG)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> JPEG lossy compression is ideal for photographs on websites.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Photographs don't need to be pixel-perfect on websites</li>
                        <li>JPEG compression can reduce images by 80-95%</li>
                        <li>Quality settings let developers balance size vs appearance</li>
                        <li>Smaller images = faster page loading = better user experience</li>
                        <li>For logos/graphics with sharp edges, PNG (lossless) may be better</li>
