            <p>For each scenario, make your prediction before revealing the answer. Think about what you know about protocols, wired/wireless connections, and addressing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 1 -->
        <section class="predict-card card" id="scenario-1">
            <h2>Scenario 1: Gaming PC Setup</h2>
            <div class="scenario-description">
                <p>Alex is setting up a gaming PC in their bedroom. They want the fastest, most reliable internet connection for online gaming where lag could mean losing a match.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Should Alex use a wired (Ethernet) or wireless (WiFi) connection? Why?</p>

                <div class="answer hidden">
                    <h3>Answer: Wired (Ethernet)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lower latency:</strong> Wired connections have less delay, crucial for competitive gaming</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistent speed:</strong> No interference from walls or other devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Higher bandwidth:</strong> Gigabit Ethernet provides faster speeds than most WiFi</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> No risk of signal drops during intense gaming sessions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the gaming PC is stationary (doesn't need to move), the lack of mobility isn't a problem.</p>

                    <h3>Answer: Bluetooth</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Designed for personal devices:</strong> Bluetooth is specifically made for connecting peripherals</li>
                        <li><strong>Low power:</strong> Uses less battery than WiFi</li>
                        <li><strong>Range is sufficient:</strong> 10m range is enough since headphones stay close to the phone</li>
                        <li><strong>Simple pairing:</strong> Easy one-time setup between devices</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>WiFi would be overkill for this purpose and would drain battery faster.</p>

                <p>Tom is about to log into his online banking to transfer money. He notices the website URL.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Should the URL start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>? Why does it matter?</p>

                    <h3>Answer: https://</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> HTTPS encrypts all data sent between browser and server</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Login credentials and financial data cannot be intercepted</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The padlock icon confirms the website's identity</li>
                        <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Banks MUST use HTTPS - if a banking site uses HTTP, it's likely fake!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Always look for the 🔒 padlock before entering sensitive information.</p>

            <div class="scenario-description">
                <p>Emma checks her email on her laptop, phone, and tablet throughout the day. She wants to see the same inbox on all devices, and when she reads an email on one device, she wants it to show as read on all devices.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Should Emma's email be configured to use POP3 or IMAP?</p>

                    <h3>Answer: IMAP</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Synchronisation:</strong> IMAP keeps emails on the server, syncing across all devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistent state:</strong> Read/unread status, folders, and labels sync automatically</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple devices:</strong> IMAP is designed for accessing email from many devices</li>
                        <li><strong>No duplicates:</strong> Unlike POP3, you won't have different emails on different devices</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>POP3 would download emails to one device and potentially delete them from the server, making multi-device access problematic.</p>

                <button class="btn btn-primary reveal-btn">Reveal Answer</button>

                    <h3>Answer: FTP (or SFTP)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>File transfer:</strong> FTP is specifically designed for uploading and downloading files</li>
                        <li><strong>Bulk transfers:</strong> Can upload many files and folders efficiently</li>
                        <li><strong>Directory navigation:</strong> Can browse and manage files on the remote server</li>
                        <li><strong>Resume capability:</strong> Can resume interrupted transfers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>HTTP/HTTPS are for viewing web pages, not for uploading files to a server. Modern practice often uses SFTP (Secure FTP) for encrypted transfers.</p>

                    <h3>Answer: MAC Address</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Permanent identifier:</strong> MAC address is fixed and unique to that specific laptop</li>
                        <li><strong>Doesn't change:</strong> Unlike IP addresses which can be reassigned</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical identification:</strong> Each NIC has a manufacturer-assigned MAC</li>
                        <li><strong>Network tracking:</strong> Switches track which MAC addresses connect to which ports</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The IP address might change if the laptop reconnects to a different part of the network, but the MAC address always stays the same.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No physical ports:</strong> Most IoT devices don't have Ethernet connections</li>

                    <h3>Answer: IPv4 format limits the number possible</h3>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fixed format:</strong> IPv4 uses 32 bits (4 numbers, 0-255 each)</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum addresses:</strong> 2^32 = approximately 4.3 billion addresses</li>
                        <li><strong>More devices than addresses:</strong> With billions of phones, computers, IoT devices, we've run out</li>
                        <li><strong>Can't change the format:</strong> Changing IPv4 would break the entire internet!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> IPv6 uses 128 bits, providing 340 undecillion addresses - enough for every grain of sand on Earth to have its own address!</p>

            <h2>Scenario 12: Layered Troubleshooting</h2>
            <div class="scenario-description">
                <p>A user complains they can't load websites. An IT technician starts troubleshooting by checking if the network cable is plugged in.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Using the concept of layers, why would the technician start with the physical connection rather than checking the web browser first?</p>
            </div>

                <button class="btn btn-primary reveal-btn">Reveal Answer</button>
                <div class="answer hidden">
                    <h3>Answer: Lower layers must work before higher layers can function</h3>
                    <p><strong>Layer-based troubleshooting:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Layer 1 (Network Access):</strong> Physical cable must be connected and working</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 2 (Internet):</strong> Device needs a valid IP address</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 3 (Transport):</strong> Data packets must be able to reach the server</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 4 (Application):</strong> Browser and website must work correctly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why start at the bottom:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the cable is unplugged (Layer 1), nothing else can work</li>
                        <li>Each layer depends on the layers below it</li>
                        <li>Start simple - check physical connections first</li>
                        <li>Work up through layers systematically to isolate the problem</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is why IT often asks "Is it plugged in?" first!</p>
