                    <h3>Answer: Email Worm</h3>
                    <p><strong>How it spreads:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User clicks malicious link or opens attachment</li>
                        <li>Worm installs itself on the computer</li>
                        <li>Worm accesses the user's email contacts</li>
                        <li>Sends copies of itself to all contacts</li>
                        <li>Recipients trust emails from known contacts, so they click too</li>
                        <li>Cycle repeats, spreading exponentially</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why worms are dangerous:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Self-replicating - spreads without user action after initial infection</li>
                        <li>Can overwhelm networks with traffic</li>
                        <li>Exploits trust between colleagues</li>
                        <li>Often carries additional malware payloads</li>

                <p>A company notices that every time they're about to launch a new product, their competitor announces a very similar product first. An IT audit reveals that keylogging software has been installed on the computers of several executives.</p>

                    <p><strong>How keyloggers work:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Records every keystroke made on the computer</li>
                        <li>Captures passwords, emails, documents as they're typed</li>
                        <li>Sends recorded data back to the attacker</li>
                        <li>Runs invisibly in the background</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Following an authorised person through a secure entrance</li>
                        <li>Exploits politeness - people hold doors for others</li>
