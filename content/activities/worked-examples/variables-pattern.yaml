  title: "Storing and Using Information"
  topic: variables
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: core

  problem:
    statement: "Create a program that stores a person's name and age, then displays a greeting message"
    context: |
      When writing programs, we often need to store information to use later.
      Variables let us save data and give it a meaningful name, like labelled boxes.
    inputs: "Name: Sam, Age: 14"
    outputs: |
      Hello, Sam!
      You are 14 years old.

  language: python

  subgoals:
    - label: "Choose meaningful variable names"
      code: 'name = "Sam"'
      explanation: |
        We create a variable called "name" and store the text "Sam" in it.
        Variable names should describe what they hold.
        The quotes tell Python this is a string (text).
      highlight: true

      variations:
        - description: "Different naming styles"
          alternative_code: 'player_name = "Sam"  # More specific name'

      prior_knowledge: "None required"

      misconceptions:
        - wrong_approach: 'Using name = Sam without quotes'
          why_wrong: "Python would think Sam is another variable"
          correction: "Use quotes to indicate text: name = \"Sam\""

    - label: "Store the age as a number"
      code: "age = 14"
      explanation: |
        We store the number 14 in a variable called "age".
        Notice there are NO quotes - this tells Python it's a number (integer),
        not text. We can do maths with integers.
      highlight: true

      variations:
        - description: "Decimal numbers"
          alternative_code: "height = 1.65  # This is a float (decimal)"

      prior_knowledge: "Variable assignment"

      misconceptions:
        - wrong_approach: 'Using age = "14" with quotes'
          why_wrong: "This makes it text, so you can't do maths with it"
          correction: "For numbers you'll calculate with, don't use quotes"

    - label: "Display the greeting with the name"
      code: 'print("Hello,", name + "!")'
      explanation: |
        We use print() to display output.
        The comma separates items to print (adds a space).
        We use + to join the name with "!" to make "Sam!".
      highlight: true

      prior_knowledge: "print() function basics"

      misconceptions:
        - wrong_approach: 'print("Hello, name!")'
          why_wrong: "This prints the text 'name', not the variable's value"
          correction: "Put variables outside the quotes to use their values"

    - label: "Display the age message"
      code: 'print("You are", age, "years old.")'
      explanation: |
        We mix text and variables in print().
        The commas automatically add spaces between each item.
        Python converts the number to text for display.
      highlight: false

      prior_knowledge: "print() with multiple items"

      misconceptions:
        - wrong_approach: 'print("You are" + age + "years old.")'
          why_wrong: "Can't use + with strings and numbers directly"
          correction: "Use commas, or convert: str(age)"

  complete_code: |
    # Store information in variables
    name = "Sam"
    age = 14

    # Display the greeting
    print("Hello,", name + "!")
    print("You are", age, "years old.")

  expected_output: |
    Hello, Sam!
    You are 14 years old.

            Think of a variable as a labelled box:
            - The NAME is the label on the box
            - The VALUE is what's inside the box
            - = means "put this in the box"

# Additional worked example: Data types and calculations

worked_example:
  id: we-variables-002
  title: "Working with Different Data Types"
  topic: variables
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: core

  problem:
    statement: "Calculate the total price of items including a discount"
    context: |
      Programs work with different types of data: text (strings), whole numbers
      (integers), and decimal numbers (floats). Understanding these helps
      avoid errors and write correct calculations.
    inputs: "Price: £25.50, Discount: 10%"
    outputs: |
      Original price: 25.5
      After 10% discount: 22.95

  language: python

  subgoals:
    - label: "Store the price as a decimal number"
      code: "price = 25.50"
      explanation: |
        Prices often have pence/cents, so we use a decimal number
        (called a "float" in Python). The .50 makes this a float.
      highlight: true

      prior_knowledge: "Variable assignment"

      misconceptions:
        - wrong_approach: 'Using price = "25.50"'
          why_wrong: "This is text, not a number - can't do maths"
          correction: "Don't use quotes for numbers you'll calculate with"

    - label: "Store the discount percentage"
      code: "discount_percent = 10"
      explanation: |
        We use an integer (whole number) for the percentage.
        Note the underscore in the variable name - this is
        how we make multi-word names readable.
      highlight: true

      prior_knowledge: "Variable naming"

    - label: "Calculate the discount amount"
      code: "discount_amount = price * discount_percent / 100"
      explanation: |
        To find 10% of the price: multiply by 10, then divide by 100.
        This gives us 2.55 (the amount to subtract).

        Calculation: 25.50 × 10 ÷ 100 = 2.55
      highlight: true

      prior_knowledge: "Arithmetic operators (* and /)"

    - label: "Calculate the final price"
      code: "final_price = price - discount_amount"
      explanation: |
        Subtract the discount from the original price.
        25.50 - 2.55 = 22.95
      highlight: true

      prior_knowledge: "Variable calculation and assignment"

    - label: "Display the results"
      code: |
        print("Original price:", price)
        print("After 10% discount:", final_price)
      explanation: |
        Display both values so the user can see the saving.
        Python automatically converts the numbers to text for display.
      highlight: false

  complete_code: |
    # Store the price and discount
    price = 25.50
    discount_percent = 10

    # Calculate the discount
    discount_amount = price * discount_percent / 100
    final_price = price - discount_amount

    # Display results
    print("Original price:", price)
    print("After 10% discount:", final_price)

  expected_output: |
    Original price: 25.5
    After 10% discount: 22.95

  self_explanation_prompts:
    - after_subgoal: 1
      prompt: "Why is 25.50 a float but 10 is an integer?"

    - after_subgoal: 3
      prompt: "What would discount_amount be if price was £50?"

    - after_subgoal: 4
      prompt: "Why do we store the result instead of just printing price - discount_amount?"

  objectives:
    - "Work with different data types (integers and floats)"
    - "Perform calculations with variables"
    - "Store intermediate results in variables"
