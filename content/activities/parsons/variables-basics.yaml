# Problem 1: Foundation - Create and print a variable

parsons_problem:
  id: parsons-variables-001
  title: "Store and Display a Name"
  topic: variables
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: foundation
  type: 2d

  problem_statement: |
    Arrange the code blocks to create a program that stores
    the name "Alice" in a variable and then prints it.

    Expected output:
    Alice

  expected_output: "Alice"
  language: python

  blocks:
    - id: 1
      code: 'name = "Alice"'
      indent_level: 0
      is_distractor: false

    - id: 2
      code: 'print(name)'
      indent_level: 0
      is_distractor: false

  solution:
    order: [1, 2]

  distractors:
    enabled: false

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "You need to create a variable before you can use it"
    - level: 2
      hint: "The = sign assigns a value to a variable"
    - level: 3
      hint: "print() displays the value stored in a variable"

  differentiation:
    foundation:
      notes: "Pre-place the assignment line; student only arranges print"
      blocks_to_pre_place: [1]
    extension:
      notes: "Add more variables to print"
      additional_distractors: []

  objectives:
    - "Understand how to create a variable"
    - "Understand how to display a variable's value"

  common_errors:
    - error_pattern: "print before assignment"
      feedback: "You must create a variable before you can use it"
    - error_pattern: 'Using print("name") instead of print(name)'
      feedback: "Quotes make it print the text 'name', not the variable's value"

  title: "Two Variables"
  topic: variables
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: foundation
  type: 2d

  problem_statement: |
    Arrange the code blocks to create a program that stores
    a name and an age, then prints both.

    Expected output:
    Sam
    15

  expected_output: "Sam\n15"
  language: python

  blocks:
    - id: 1
      code: 'name = "Sam"'

      indent_level: 0
      is_distractor: false

  solution:
    order: [1, 2, 3, 4]

  distractors:
    enabled: false

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "Create both variables first, then print them"
    - level: 2
      hint: "Strings need quotes, numbers don't"
    - level: 3
      hint: "Print statements come after variable creation"

  hints:

    - level: 2
      hint: "Then calculate the total and store it"
    - level: 3
      hint: "Finally, print the total"

  objectives:
    - "Use variables in calculations"
    - "Store calculation results in new variables"

  common_errors:
    - error_pattern: "Using total before creating a and b"
      feedback: "You can't use a and b until they exist"
    - error_pattern: "Using = instead of +"
      feedback: "Use + for addition, = is for assignment"

  problem_statement: |
    Arrange the code to start with a score of 10,
    add 5 bonus points, then print the final score.

  topic: variables
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: extension
  type: 2d

  problem_statement: |
    Arrange the code to swap the values of x and y.
    x starts as 10, y starts as 20. After swapping,
    x should be 20 and y should be 10.
