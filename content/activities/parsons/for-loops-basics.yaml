# Problem 1: Foundation - Print Hello 3 times

parsons_problem:
  id: parsons-for-loop-001
  title: "Print Hello Three Times"
  topic: for-loops
  stage: ks3
  difficulty: foundation
  type: 2d

  problem_statement: |
    Arrange the code blocks to create a program that prints
    "Hello" three times, each on a new line.

    Expected output:
    Hello
    Hello
    Hello

  expected_output: "Hello\nHello\nHello"
  language: python

  blocks:
    - id: 1
      code: 'for i in range(3):'

  solution:

  distractors:

  hints:
    - level: 1
      hint: "The for loop line always comes first"
    - level: 2
      hint: "The print line needs to be inside the loop (indented)"
    - level: 3
      hint: "In Python, code inside a loop is indented to the right"

      blocks_to_pre_place: [1]
    extension:
      notes: "Add distractor blocks or require typing the number"
      additional_distractors: []

  objectives:
    - "Understand that for loops repeat code"
    - "Recognise the structure of a for loop"

  common_errors:
    - error_pattern: "print before for"
      feedback: "The for line creates the loop - it must come first"
    - error_pattern: "print not indented"
      feedback: "In Python, code inside a loop must be indented"

    - level: 2
      hint: "The variable i holds each number in turn"
    - level: 3
      hint: "print(i) will display the current value of i"

  objectives:
    - "Understand that the loop variable changes each iteration"
    - "Recognise that range(5) produces 0 to 4"

  common_errors:
    - error_pattern: "Expecting range(5) to give 1-5"
