  introduction:
    hook: "Look around you - how many computers can you see? Just your phone and laptop? Actually, there are probably dozens! Your watch, TV remote, microwave, car key, even your toothbrush might contain a computer. These hidden computers are called embedded systems."

        definition: |
          An embedded system is a computer system that is built into a larger device
          to perform ONE specific, dedicated function.

          Unlike a general-purpose computer (like a PC or laptop) that can run many
          different programs, an embedded system is designed to do just one job.

        key_points:
          - "Built INTO another device (not standalone)"
          - "Performs a SINGLE dedicated function"
          - "Usually invisible to the user"
          - "User doesn't interact with it like a traditional computer"

  exam_tip: |
    When answering questions about embedded systems, always emphasize that they
    perform a SINGLE, SPECIFIC function. Give concrete examples with their
    specific purpose (e.g., "a washing machine controller that manages wash cycles"
    not just "a washing machine").
