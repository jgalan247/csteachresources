  introduction:
    hook: "Why does one laptop cost £400 and another £1400? Often it comes down to the CPU. Understanding CPU performance helps you make smart buying decisions and understand why some computers feel faster than others."

    key_question: "What makes one CPU faster than another?"

  sections:
    - title: "1. Clock Speed"
      content:
        explanation: |
          Clock speed is like the heartbeat of the CPU. Every 'tick' of the clock allows
          the CPU to perform operations. The faster the clock ticks, the more operations
          can be performed per second.

          Clock speed is measured in Hertz (Hz):
          - 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second
          - 1 MHz = 1 million cycles per second
          - 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second

          Modern CPUs typically run at 2-5 GHz.

        analogy: |
          Think of clock speed like a drummer in a band. The drummer sets the pace for
          everyone else. A faster drum beat (higher clock speed) means the band can
          play faster. But there's a limit - if the drummer plays too fast, the other
          musicians can't keep up!

        effect_on_performance:
          positive:
            - "More instructions processed per second"
            - "Programs run faster"
            - "Better responsiveness"
          negative:
            - "Higher clock speeds generate more heat"
            - "Use more electrical power"
            - "There's a physical limit to how fast a clock can tick"

        exam_points:
          - "Higher clock speed = more cycles per second = faster processing"
          - "Measured in GHz (gigahertz) for modern CPUs"
          - "Not the only factor - a 3GHz CPU isn't always faster than a 2GHz CPU"
          - "Increasing clock speed increases power consumption and heat"

    - title: "2. Cache Size"
      content:
        explanation: |
          Cache is small, super-fast memory built directly into the CPU. It stores
          copies of data that the CPU uses frequently, so it doesn't have to fetch
          from the slower RAM every time.

          Cache comes in levels:
          - L1 Cache: Smallest (typically 32-64KB), fastest, closest to CPU cores
          - L2 Cache: Medium (typically 256KB-1MB), slightly slower
          - L3 Cache: Largest (typically 4-32MB), shared between all cores

        analogy: |
          Imagine you're writing an essay. Your desk (cache) holds the books you're
          using right now. The bookshelf (RAM) is across the room. The library (hard
          drive) is across town.

          - Getting a book from your desk = instant (cache hit)
          - Walking to the bookshelf = takes time (RAM access)
          - Going to the library = takes ages (hard drive access)

          A bigger desk means more books within reach = less time wasted walking!

        effect_on_performance:
          positive:
            - "Reduces time waiting for data from RAM"
            - "Cache hits are much faster than RAM access"
            - "Keeps frequently used data close to the CPU"
          negative:
            - "Very expensive per megabyte"
            - "Takes up space on the CPU chip"
            - "More cache = higher cost"

        cache_comparison:
          L1: "~4 clock cycles to access"
          L2: "~10 clock cycles to access"
          L3: "~40 clock cycles to access"
          RAM: "~100+ clock cycles to access"

        exam_points:
          - "Larger cache = more data stored close to CPU = fewer slow RAM accesses"
          - "Cache is much faster than RAM but much smaller"
          - "L1 is fastest but smallest; L3 is largest but slowest"
          - "A 'cache hit' (data found in cache) is much faster than a 'cache miss'"

    - title: "3. Number of Cores"
      content:
        explanation: |
          A core is like a complete mini-CPU that can execute instructions independently.
          Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to run multiple tasks at the
          same time (in parallel).

          Common configurations:
          - Dual-core: 2 cores
          - Quad-core: 4 cores
          - Hexa-core: 6 cores
          - Octa-core: 8 cores
          - High-end: 16, 32, or even 64 cores

        analogy: |
          Think of cores like checkout tills in a supermarket:
          - 1 core = 1 checkout = customers queue up, served one at a time
          - 4 cores = 4 checkouts = 4 customers served simultaneously
          - 8 cores = 8 checkouts = even more customers served at once

          BUT: If there's only one customer, having 8 checkouts doesn't help!
          Similarly, if software only uses 1 core, extra cores won't speed it up.

        effect_on_performance:
          positive:
            - "Can run multiple programs simultaneously"
            - "Programs designed for multi-threading run faster"
            - "Better at multitasking"
          negative:
            - "Not all software can use multiple cores"
            - "Some tasks can't be split into parallel parts"
            - "More cores don't help single-threaded applications"

        parallelism_note: |
          Important: More cores only help if the software is designed to use them.
          - Video editing, 3D rendering, scientific simulations = benefit greatly
          - Simple programs, older software = may only use one core

        exam_points:
          - "More cores = ability to process multiple instructions simultaneously"
          - "Software must be written to use multiple cores (multi-threaded)"
          - "Good for multitasking and parallel processing"
          - "Doubling cores does NOT double performance for all tasks"

    - title: "4. Combined Effects"
      content:
        explanation: |
          In reality, all three factors work together. Understanding how they interact
          is crucial for evaluating CPU performance.

        scenarios:
          - scenario: "Gaming"
            best_configuration: "High clock speed + moderate cores (4-8) + good cache"
            reason: "Many games prefer fast single-thread performance but can use 4-8 cores"

          - scenario: "Video Editing"
            best_configuration: "Many cores + decent clock speed + large cache"
            reason: "Video encoding is highly parallelisable - more cores = faster rendering"

          - scenario: "Web Browsing / Office Work"
            best_configuration: "Moderate clock speed + 2-4 cores + moderate cache"
            reason: "Light tasks don't need extreme performance"

          - scenario: "Scientific Computing"
            best_configuration: "Many cores + large cache + good clock speed"
            reason: "Complex calculations benefit from parallel processing"

        trade_offs:
          - "Higher clock speed often means fewer cores (heat limitations)"
          - "More cores often means lower per-core clock speed"
          - "Larger cache increases cost significantly"
          - "Best balance depends on what the computer will be used for"

        exam_points:
          - "Be able to explain how changing ONE factor affects performance"
          - "Be able to explain how factors work TOGETHER"
          - "Understand trade-offs (e.g., more cores might mean lower clock speed)"
          - "Know that 'best' depends on the use case"

common_misconceptions:
  - misconception: "Higher GHz always means faster"
    correction: "A newer 2GHz CPU may outperform an older 3GHz CPU due to better architecture"

  - misconception: "More cores always means better performance"
    correction: "Only if software is designed to use multiple cores; single-threaded tasks won't benefit"

  - misconception: "Cache is just small RAM"
    correction: "Cache is physically different, built into the CPU, and operates at CPU speeds"

  - misconception: "You can just increase all three factors infinitely"
    correction: "There are physical limits - higher clock speeds generate heat, more transistors need more power"

exam_questions:
  - question: "State two factors that affect CPU performance"
    marks: 2
    answer: "Any two of: Clock speed, Cache size, Number of cores"

  - question: "Explain why increasing the clock speed of a CPU improves performance"
    marks: 2
    answer: |
      Higher clock speed means more cycles per second (1 mark).
      This means more instructions can be fetched, decoded, and executed per second (1 mark).

  - question: "A user is choosing between two laptops. Laptop A has a 3.0GHz dual-core processor. Laptop B has a 2.4GHz quad-core processor. The user primarily uses video editing software. Explain which laptop would be better for their needs."
    marks: 4
    answer: |
      Laptop B would be better (1 mark) because video editing software is designed to
      use multiple cores/is multi-threaded (1 mark). The quad-core processor can process
      four tasks simultaneously (1 mark). Although it has a lower clock speed, the ability
      to use all four cores for rendering will make video editing faster overall (1 mark).

  - question: "Explain the role of cache memory in improving CPU performance"
    marks: 3
    answer: |
      Cache stores frequently used data/instructions close to the CPU (1 mark).
      This is much faster than accessing RAM (1 mark).
      When the CPU needs data, it checks cache first - a 'cache hit' is much faster
      than fetching from RAM (1 mark).

  - question: "State and explain two limitations of increasing CPU clock speed to improve performance"
    marks: 4
    answer: |
      1. Heat: Higher clock speeds generate more heat (1 mark), which can damage
         components or require expensive cooling (1 mark).
      2. Power consumption: Higher clock speeds use more electricity (1 mark),
         reducing battery life in laptops/increasing running costs (1 mark).
      Alternative answers: Physical limits of transistor switching speed,
      diminishing returns, other components become bottlenecks.

summary:
  key_points:
    - "Clock speed: Higher = more cycles per second = faster processing (but more heat/power)"
    - "Cache size: Larger = more data stored close to CPU = fewer slow RAM accesses"
    - "Number of cores: More = can run more tasks simultaneously (if software supports it)"
    - "All three factors work together to determine overall CPU performance"
    - "The 'best' balance depends on what the computer will be used for"

  exam_tip: |
    Questions often ask you to compare CPUs or recommend one for a specific task.
    Always consider: What is the computer being used for? Does that task benefit
    from more cores (parallel processing) or faster single-thread speed?
