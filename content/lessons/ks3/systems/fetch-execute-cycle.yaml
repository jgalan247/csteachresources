# ============================================
# LESSON PHASES
# ============================================

# PHASE 1: HOOK (5-10 minutes)
# Activate prior knowledge, create curiosity
hook:
  activity: |
    Display an image of a CPU chip (zoomed in on computer motherboard).
    Ask: "This tiny chip can do billions of calculations every second.
    How do you think it knows what to do?"

  retrieval_questions:
    - question: "What is hardware? Give me an example."
      expected_answer: "Physical parts of a computer you can touch - keyboard, monitor, etc."
    - question: "What is software?"
      expected_answer: "Programs/instructions that tell the hardware what to do"
    - question: "If hardware is the body, what is software?"
      expected_answer: "The brain/mind/instructions"

  real_world_connection: |
    Every time you play a game, watch a video, or type a message, the CPU is
    processing millions of instructions. Understanding how it works helps us
    understand why computers sometimes slow down, and why some computers are
    faster than others.

# PHASE 2: UNPACK (15-20 minutes)
# Concrete, unplugged introduction - semantic waves
unpack:
  description: |
    Use the "Human CPU" unplugged activity to make the abstract fetch-execute
    cycle concrete and memorable. Students physically act out the CPU's operation.

  unplugged_activity:
    name: "Human CPU Simulation"
    description: |
      Students take on roles of CPU components and physically act out the
      fetch-execute cycle, passing instruction cards and performing actions.

    materials:
      - "Role cards: Control Unit (1), ALU (1), Registers (3-4), RAM (1)"
      - "Instruction cards (printed, simple operations like ADD 5, SUBTRACT 3)"
      - "Number cards (0-20) for register values"
      - "Whiteboard or flip chart for 'output screen'"
      - "Coloured bibs or labels to identify roles (optional)"

    setup_instructions: |
      1. Arrange classroom with distinct areas:
         - "RAM corner" with instruction cards in order
         - "CPU area" in centre with Register, ALU, and Control Unit positions
         - "Output screen" (whiteboard) visible to all
      2. Assign 6-7 students to active roles, others observe first round
      3. Display the cycle diagram on board for reference

    activity_steps:
      - step: 1
        instruction: |
          FETCH: The Control Unit student goes to RAM and collects the NEXT
          instruction card. They bring it back to the CPU area and announce:
          "I have fetched instruction: [reads card]"
        teacher_note: |
          Emphasise that instructions must be fetched IN ORDER from RAM.
          The Control Unit keeps track of which instruction comes next.

      - step: 2
        instruction: |
          DECODE: The Control Unit student reads the instruction and works out
          what needs to happen. They announce: "This instruction means we need to..."
          (e.g., "add 5 to the number in Register 1")
        teacher_note: |
          This is where the instruction is "translated" from code to action.
          Ask: "Why can't the ALU just read the instruction directly?"

      - step: 3
        instruction: |
          EXECUTE: If calculation needed, Control Unit tells ALU what to do.
          ALU student collects number cards from relevant Register students,
          performs the calculation (using calculator if needed), and announces result.
        teacher_note: |
          The ALU does the "doing" - but only when told by Control Unit.
          For non-calculation instructions (like OUTPUT), skip to relevant action.

      - step: 4
        instruction: |
          STORE: The result is given to a Register student to hold, OR
          written on the output screen if it's an OUTPUT instruction.
          Control Unit announces: "Cycle complete. Ready for next instruction."
        teacher_note: |
          Emphasise that results must be stored somewhere before the next cycle.
          Registers are temporary - they'll be overwritten.

    debrief_questions:
      - "What would happen if we skipped the FETCH stage?"
      - "Why does the Control Unit need to DECODE instructions?"
      - "What would happen if we had no Registers?"
      - "How many times does this cycle repeat when you run a program?"

    cs_connection: |
      The real CPU does this exact process, but billions of times per second!
      Each instruction is incredibly simple (add two numbers, compare values),
      but by doing billions of them, complex programs run.

  analogies:
    - analogy: "The CPU is like a chef following a recipe"
      maps_to: |
        - Chef = CPU (does the work)
        - Recipe book = RAM (stores instructions)
        - Reading recipe step = FETCH
        - Understanding what to do = DECODE
        - Chopping/mixing/cooking = EXECUTE
        - Putting food on plate = STORE result
      limitations: |
        A chef can be creative and skip steps. A CPU MUST follow instructions
        exactly in order - it cannot think for itself.

    - analogy: "Control Unit is like a project manager"
      maps_to: |
        The Control Unit coordinates everything but doesn't do calculations itself.
        It fetches the work, understands what needs doing, tells others to do it,
        and makes sure results are saved properly.
      limitations: |
        Unlike a project manager, the Control Unit has no flexibility or decision-making
        beyond exactly what the instructions say.

# PHASE 3: EXPLAIN (10-15 minutes)
# Direct instruction with dual coding
explain:
  key_points:
    - point: "The CPU is the processing centre of the computer"
      visual_support: |
        Diagram showing CPU on motherboard with arrows showing data flow
        to/from RAM, storage, and I/O devices.
      check_understanding: "What flows between the CPU and RAM?"

    - point: "The CPU has three main parts: Control Unit, ALU, and Registers"
      visual_support: |
        Labelled diagram of CPU internals showing CU, ALU, and multiple registers.
        Use colour coding: CU = blue, ALU = green, Registers = orange.
      check_understanding: "Which part does the calculations?"

    - point: "The fetch-execute cycle has four stages that repeat continuously"
      visual_support: |
        Circular flow diagram: FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → STORE → (back to FETCH)
        Each stage in different colour with icon representation.
      check_understanding: "What comes after Decode?"

  worked_example:
    title: "Tracing a Simple Program"
    context: |
      Let's trace what happens when the CPU runs these three instructions:
      1. LOAD 7      (Put the number 7 into a register)
      2. ADD 3       (Add 3 to the number in the register)
      3. OUTPUT      (Display the result)

    steps:
      - subgoal: "Process first instruction: LOAD 7"
        action: "CPU fetches 'LOAD 7' from RAM"
        visual: "Arrow from RAM to CPU with 'LOAD 7' label"
        explanation: "Control Unit retrieves the first instruction from memory"

      - subgoal: "Decode the LOAD instruction"
        action: "Control Unit interprets: 'Put 7 into Register A'"
        visual: "CU box with 'LOAD 7 → Store 7 in Reg A' text"
        explanation: "Control Unit works out what the instruction means"

      - subgoal: "Execute the LOAD instruction"
        action: "Number 7 is placed into Register A"
        visual: "Register A box showing '7'"
        explanation: "The action is carried out - register now holds 7"

      - subgoal: "Process second instruction: ADD 3"
        action: "Fetch ADD 3, Decode as 'Add 3 to Register A', Execute using ALU"
        visual: "ALU showing 7 + 3 = 10, Register A updated to 10"
        explanation: "ALU performs calculation, result stored back in register"

      - subgoal: "Process third instruction: OUTPUT"
        action: "Fetch OUTPUT, Decode as 'Display Register A', Execute by sending to screen"
        visual: "Screen showing '10'"
        explanation: "Result is sent to output device"

    complete_walkthrough: |
      The CPU processed three instructions through three complete fetch-execute
      cycles. Each cycle: FETCH from RAM → DECODE in Control Unit →
      EXECUTE (using ALU if calculation) → STORE result.
      Final output: 10 (because 7 + 3 = 10)

        - "3. EXECUTE: Carry out the instruction"
        - "4. STORE: Save the result"

# PHASE 5: EVALUATE (5-10 minutes)
# Check understanding and address misconceptions
evaluate:
  formative_checks:
    - type: hinge_question
      content: |
        During the DECODE stage, what does the Control Unit do?
        A) Fetches the next instruction from RAM
        B) Works out what the instruction means
        C) Performs calculations on numbers
        D) Saves results to the hard drive

        (Correct: B)
      success_threshold: "80% correct before moving on"

    - type: exit_ticket
      content: |
        1. Name the three main parts of the CPU.
        2. What are the four stages of the fetch-execute cycle?
        3. Which part of the CPU does calculations?
      success_threshold: "All students can answer Q1 and Q2"

  common_misconceptions:
    - misconception: "The CPU stores programs and data"
      why_students_think_this: |
        Confusion between CPU and RAM. "Processing" sounds like it includes storage.
      diagnostic_question: "Where are programs stored while running - CPU or RAM?"
      correction_strategy: |
        Use the chef analogy: "Does the chef store all the ingredients? No - they're
        on the counter (RAM). The chef (CPU) just works with what's given to them."

    - misconception: "The ALU controls everything in the CPU"
      why_students_think_this: |
        ALU sounds important and "Arithmetic Logic" seems to cover all operations.
      diagnostic_question: "Which part tells the ALU what calculation to do?"
      correction_strategy: |
        Clarify: "The ALU is like a calculator - very good at maths, but someone
        (the Control Unit) needs to tell it which buttons to press."

    - misconception: "Fetch-Execute happens once per program"
      why_students_think_this: |
        Students may think one cycle runs the whole program.
      diagnostic_question: "If a program has 100 instructions, how many fetch-execute cycles?"
      correction_strategy: |
        "Every single instruction needs its own fetch-execute cycle. A simple
        game might need millions of cycles to run!"

    - misconception: "STORE always means saving to hard drive"
      why_students_think_this: |
        Everyday meaning of "store" implies permanent storage.
      diagnostic_question: "Where does the CPU store results during the STORE stage?"
      correction_strategy: |
        "Store in F-E cycle means saving to registers (temporary) or outputting.
        Saving to hard drive is a separate operation with different instructions."

# TEACHER GUIDANCE
teacher_notes:
  preparation:
    - "Print role cards and instruction cards for unplugged activity"
    - "Prepare CPU diagram for labelling (printed or digital)"
    - "Have trace table templates ready"
    - "Test any animations/videos in advance"
    - "Prepare exit tickets"

  common_issues:
    - "Students may struggle to distinguish Control Unit from ALU roles"
    - "The DECODE stage is often confused with EXECUTE"
    - "Students may not realise how fast and repetitive the cycle is"
    - "Register vs RAM confusion is common"

  timing_guidance: |
    Hook: 5-10 mins
    Unpack (unplugged activity): 15-20 mins
    Explain (direct instruction): 10-15 mins
    Elaborate (practice activities): 15-20 mins
    Evaluate (exit check): 5-10 mins

    If time is short, prioritise the unplugged activity - research shows
    it significantly improves understanding and retention.

  subject_knowledge:
    key_facts:
      - "Modern CPUs execute billions of cycles per second (GHz = billion cycles/sec)"
      - "Each instruction is very simple - complex operations need many instructions"
      - "Registers are the fastest memory but very limited in size"
    deeper_understanding: |
      The fetch-execute cycle is a simplification. Real CPUs use pipelining
      (multiple instructions in different stages simultaneously) and branch
      prediction. At KS3, focus on the basic four-stage model.
    historical_context: |
      The fetch-execute cycle was formalised in the Von Neumann architecture
      (1945). John Von Neumann described a computer with stored programs
      where instructions and data share the same memory.
