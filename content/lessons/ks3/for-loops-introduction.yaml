# KS3 For Loops Introduction
# A complete PRIMM lesson for introducing count-controlled iteration

id: ks3-for-loops-001
title: "Introduction to For Loops"
topic: for-loops
stage: ks3
year_group: 8
duration_minutes: 60

objectives:
  - Understand that for loops repeat code a specific number of times
  - Trace the execution of a simple for loop
  - Modify a for loop to change the number of iterations
  - Write a for loop to solve a simple repetition problem

success_criteria:
  - I can predict what a for loop will output
  - I can trace the values of the loop variable through each iteration
  - I can change how many times a loop runs
  - I can write a for loop to repeat an action

prerequisites:
  concepts:
    - Variables and assignment
    - Print statements
    - Sequential execution
  lessons:
    - ks3-variables-001
    - ks3-output-001

vocabulary:
  - term: iteration
    definition: One pass through a loop; doing something repeatedly
    example: "Printing 'Hello' 5 times requires 5 iterations"

  - term: for loop
    definition: A loop that repeats a specific number of times
    example: "for i in range(5):"

  - term: loop variable
    definition: The variable that changes each time through the loop
    example: "In 'for i in range(5)', i is the loop variable"

  - term: range
    definition: A function that generates a sequence of numbers
    example: "range(5) gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4"

    discussion:

    prompts:
      - "How many times will 'Hello' be printed?"
      - "What does 'range(3)' do?"
      - "What values will i have during execution?"

    misconceptions:
      - prediction: "'Hello' prints 1 time"
        why: "Student doesn't recognise loop structure"
        address: "Highlight the for keyword and explain it means repetition"

      - prediction: "'Hello' prints 4 times (0,1,2,3)"
        why: "Confusing range count with starting from 0"
        address: "Count the numbers: 0, 1, 2 - that's 3 numbers"

      - prediction: "The number 3 will be printed"
        why: "Confusing the loop variable with the output"
        address: "We print 'Hello' (a string), not i (the variable)"

  run:
    enabled: true
    expected_output: |
      Hello
      Hello
      Hello

    reflection_prompts:
      - "Was your prediction correct?"
      - "How many times did 'Hello' actually print?"
      - "What did range(3) actually produce?"

    misconception_intervention: |
      If students predicted wrong, trace through together:
      "Let's follow what Python does step by step..."

    activities:
      - type: tracing
        instructions: |
          Complete the trace table for this program.
          Track the value of i and what gets printed at each step.

          variables: [i]
          include_output: true

      - type: annotation

            prompt: "Label: the loop body (what gets repeated)"

      - type: identify_constructs
        instructions: |
          In the code below, identify:
          1. The loop variable
          2. How many times the loop runs
          3. The loop body

  modify:
    enabled: true
    base_code: |
      for i in range(3):
          print("Hello")

    modifications:
      foundation:
        - instruction: "Change the program to print 'Hello' 5 times instead of 3"
          hint: "Look at the number in range() - what should it be?"
          solution: |
            for i in range(5):
                print("Hello")

        - instruction: "Change the program to print 'Goodbye' instead of 'Hello'"
          hint: "Look at what's inside the print() function"
          solution: |
            for i in range(3):
                print("Goodbye")

      core:
        - instruction: "Modify the program to print the numbers 0, 1, 2 (one per line)"
          hint: "What variable already contains these numbers?"
          solution: |
            for i in range(3):
                print(i)

        - instruction: "Modify the program to print 'Hello' followed by the number (Hello 0, Hello 1, Hello 2)"
          hint: "You can print multiple things: print('Hello', i)"
          solution: |
            for i in range(3):
                print("Hello", i)

      extension:
        - instruction: "Modify the program to print the numbers 1 to 5 (not 0 to 4)"
          hint: "range() can take two numbers: range(start, stop)"
          solution: |
            for i in range(1, 6):
                print(i)

        - instruction: "Make the program print 'Iteration X of 5' for each iteration"
          hint: "Think about how to construct the message"
          solution: |
            for i in range(1, 6):
                print("Iteration", i, "of 5")

    common_errors:
      - error: "for i in range(3) (missing colon)"
        feedback: "In Python, loop headers end with a colon (:)"

      - error: "print('Hello') not indented"
        feedback: "Code inside the loop must be indented (press Tab)"

      - error: "for i in range(1, 5): when wanting 1-5"
        feedback: "range(1, 5) gives 1, 2, 3, 4. To include 5, use range(1, 6)"

    challenge: |
      Create a program that displays a countdown from 5 to 1,
      then prints "Blast off!"

      Expected output:
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
      Blast off!

        description: "Complete the starter code to make the countdown work"
        starter_code: |
          # Print numbers 5 down to 1
          for i in range(__, __, __):
              print(__)

          # Print the final message
          print("Blast off!")

      core:
        description: "Create the countdown program"
        starter_code: |
          # Your countdown code here

          print("Blast off!")

      extension:
        description: |
          Create the countdown program, then extend it to:
          1. Ask the user what number to count down from
          2. Display "T-minus X seconds" for each number
        starter_code: |
          # Your code here

    success_criteria:
      - Program prints numbers from 5 to 1
      - Numbers appear in descending order
      - "Blast off!" appears after the countdown
      - Code uses a for loop (not 5 separate print statements)

    rubric:
      - criterion: "Countdown displays correctly"
        levels:
          emerging: "Some numbers display but not in correct order"
          developing: "Numbers 5-1 display but 'Blast off' missing or wrong"
          secure: "Full countdown works correctly"
          mastering: "Countdown works with user input and enhanced messages"

      - criterion: "For loop used correctly"
        levels:
          emerging: "Attempted loop but syntax incorrect"
          developing: "Loop works but doesn't produce countdown"
          secure: "Loop correctly produces countdown"
          mastering: "Loop uses variables effectively"

    - "Let's trace through to check our answer"
    - "I think we need a colon at the end of that line"
    - "Can you run it to see if our prediction was right?"

teacher_notes:
  preparation: |
    - Load Python environment with code ready to display
    - Print trace table templates (see investigate activities)
    - Prepare mini-whiteboards or voting cards for predictions
    - Have Python Tutor open as backup visualisation

  common_issues:
    - "Students often confuse range(5) counting 5 times with counting to 5"
    - "Indentation errors are common - demonstrate Tab key explicitly"
    - "Some students will try to write the loop variable inside range()"
